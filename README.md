# ü™ê Exoplanet Detection AI

**Discover new worlds with the power of Machine Learning! This interactive web app uses a highly accurate AI model to predict whether a celestial object is an exoplanet based on data from NASA's Kepler mission.**

## ## Project Overview

This project tackles the challenge of identifying exoplanets from the vast datasets provided by NASA's space telescopes. Instead of manual analysis, this tool leverages a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the cumulative Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) data to automatically classify planetary candidates. The model achieves an impressive **99.25% accuracy**, providing a reliable tool for both astronomers and space enthusiasts.

The entire application is built in Python and deployed as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.

## ## Features ‚ú®

- **Interactive UI**: Adjust 19 different astronomical features using sliders and input boxes to describe a potential planet.
- **High-Accuracy Model**: Utilizes a Scikit-learn Random Forest model trained on thousands of confirmed exoplanets and false positives.
- **Instant Predictions**: Get a real-time prediction‚Äîeither **CONFIRMED Exoplanet** or **FALSE POSITIVE**.
- **AI Transparency**: A **Feature Importance** chart shows you which data points the AI valued most for its decision.
- **Celebratory Animations**: Discovering a new world is exciting, and our app celebrates every "CONFIRMED" prediction with a fun animation!
